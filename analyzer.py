# WARNING: This file's primary function `perform_analysis_and_plot_radar`
# is largely redundant and no longer called by `paper.py` for its core logic.
# The radar data calculation and plotting responsibilities have been moved
# to `paper.py` and `person_status.py` respectively, as per the design evolution.
#
# This file is kept to satisfy imports, but its main function is effectively
# unused by the current `paper.py` application flow for radar generation
# and text analysis.
